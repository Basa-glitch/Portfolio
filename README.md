## Projects
### Affordable AI Powered Dermatology Technology

This project aims to develop AI based teledermatology which is equipped with a disease identification intelligent system. 
The role I was given for this is to specifically explore Edge AI potential for skin disease identification which is intended to be deployed on low resource device.

### Automatic embedded system for heart disease identification based on phonocardiogram
[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11253966)

A portable and low cost device that can be used by both professional and non-professionals to detect for a person’s heart condition as early as possible. 
The device uses a stethoscope with a microphone embedded into it to receive data of the patient’s heartbeat.
The data taken by the stethoscope is used for the machine learning model to classify the patient’s heart in three different categories: normal, murmur or abnormal.
These results are displayed onto a LCD.

### Fish Counter

An automated device that can count accurately the number of fishes and when the machine reaches a specific quota, a barrier lowers down to seal entry. 
The aim of this project is to prevent over fishing, especially in Indonesia which has one of the largest fishing grounds in the world.
A machine learning model is used track the position of the fishes and display a line in the webcam to start counting the fishes that had passed through the line.
An Arduino is used to control the rotations of the motor and block the path to stop fishes from entering the area

### Two Wheel Security Bot

A roaming security robot with two coaxial wheels mounted on either side of an intermediate body, with a centre of mass above the wheel axles, and therefore, must actively stabilize themselves to prevent toppling. 
This robot will provide support to the current limited security system, while CCTV has blind spots and security officer might not be able to patrol 24/7.
This robot will increase the effectiveness of security by patrolling large complex of warehouse or factory lanes.

### TrackPoint

TrackPoint is an asset tracking & quality control system that tracks the asset ID, location, and condition.
It’s achieved by using a camera to scan for a Barcode, QR Code and the package itself.
The codes contain information on the storage facility (location) and ID, while using Machine Learning to predict the condition of the package.
The mobile app is used to track the location of the box and monitor its conditions and location.
